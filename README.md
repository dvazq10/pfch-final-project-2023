2023 PFCH Final Project

<h2><b>"<i>Dogs in Paintings</i>"</b>

An exploration of canines depicted in paintings found on wikidata.</h2>

<h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>

The inspiration for my project came to me while visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art. I came across an exhibition called "In Praise of Painting: Dutch Masterpieces at The Met". As a dog owner, I found myself spotting all the dogs in the various domestic paintins on view while I perused the gallery. Later on when I started my project, I elected to explore the various items in wikidata and narrow my query down to depictions of dogs in all instances of paintings. My main goal was to extract as much information as I could, and explore the data.

<h3><b>Dataset</b></h3>

The main source of the data came from Wikidata, an open data repository. I used the Wikidata Query Service to construct a SPARQL query to explore the data I wanted in Wikidata.

<h3><b>Method</b></h3>

Step 1:

Construct a query using Wikidata Query Service and test it with their visual interface for errors, and then review results. 

You can find the query I built with this link: https://w.wiki/6g6t

The query was built with the intention of gathering QID's which have the property "instance of" with a the value of "painting" <b>and</b> also "depicts" with the value "dog". In addition, the query includes the optional properties:

<ol>
<li>image </li>
<li>location </li>
<li>collection </li>  
<li>owned by </li>
<li>creator </li>  
<li>made from material</li>  
<li>country</li>  
<li>igenre</li> 
<li>described at URL</li>
<li>copyright status</li>
<li>time period</li>
<li>movement</li>
<li>inception</li>  
<li>title</li>
